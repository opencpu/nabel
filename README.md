Nabel OpenCPU App
-----------------

This is one of the example OpenCPU apps. To install it:

    library(devtools)
    install_github("nabel", "opencpu")

To run it, start opencpu

    library(opencpu)

And then open the App in the browser, for example:

    http://localhost:12345/library/nabel/www

Like all OpenCPU apps, it's just a R function:

    library(nabel)
    nabel()
